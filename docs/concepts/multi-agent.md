# Multi-agent workflows

Multi-agent workflows are first-class in Tulip: eight shapes you compose
in one process or scale across a mesh, every shape backed by the same
`Agent` class, the same event stream, and the same primitives. Compose the
shape that fits the work.

![Multi-agent workflow shapes — Composition, Orchestrator + Specialists, Swarm, Handoff, StateGraph, Functional, A2A](../img/multi-agent-patterns.svg)

!!! tip "Don't know which shape to use?"
    See [Pick a shape](#pick-a-shape) — three questions get you there. For
    a straight chain or fan-out, start with
    [Composition](multi-agent/composition.md).

## What you can ship today

Every example below is a real `examples/notebook_NN_*.py` file in the
repo, runs end-to-end against the bundled `MockModel` (no creds), and
upgrades to a live provider by setting one env var.

| | Workflow | One line | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **29** | DeepAgent — research factory | `create_deepagent` with reflexion + grounding + subagent dispatch + `deepagent.*` SSE events. | [`notebook_29_deepagent.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_29_deepagent.py) |
| **30** | Customer-support triage at scale | Scatter 3 tickets × 3 lenses (sentiment, routing, resolution) to 9 analyst agents via `Send`, reduce into one triage summary. | [`notebook_30_map_reduce_code_review.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_30_map_reduce_code_review.py) |
| **31** | Supervisor + critic loop | Recon → Report author → Skeptical reviewer, loop back to the author until the reviewer approves (cap'd revisions). | [`notebook_31_supervisor_critic_loop.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_31_supervisor_critic_loop.py) |
| **32** | Adversarial debate + judge | One agent argues the finding is a true positive, another argues benign, across N rounds; Judge emits a typed `Verdict` via `output_schema`. | [`notebook_32_debate_with_judge.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_32_debate_with_judge.py) |
| **33** | Multi-agent + human-in-the-loop | Three patterns in one file: approval gate, human-as-tool, long-pause snapshot/resume. | [`notebook_33_multiagent_human_in_loop.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_33_multiagent_human_in_loop.py) |
| **63** | IR (incident-response) war-room | Triage → 3 parallel investigators (SIEM — a security team's log platform — EDR, and threat intel) → severity gate → page-the-responder → contain → typed `Postmortem`. | [`notebook_63_incident_response.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_63_incident_response.py) |
| **64** | Customer-support concession approval | Ticket analyst → Impact analyst → risk-tier router (auto / support manager / +billing / +director) → typed `ConcessionDecision`. Stacked `interrupt()` gates on the top tiers. | [`notebook_64_procurement_approval.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_64_procurement_approval.py) |
| **65** | DPA & security-addendum review | Parser → 3 parallel reviewers (privacy / security / compliance) → revision gate → human analyst → `Command(goto="sign_off")` short-circuits when resolved. Cycles enabled. | [`notebook_65_contract_review.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/examples/notebook_65_contract_review.py) |

## Pick a shape

Three questions get you to the right shape almost every time:

1. **Do agents need to talk across processes or runtimes?** If yes, you
   want **A2A**. If no, everything else lives in one Python process.
2. **Does the flow have cycles or conditional routing?** If yes, you
   want **StateGraph**. If it's a straight chain or fan-out, you want
   **Composition**.
3. **Do you want one coordinator picking the next agent, or peers
   collaborating without a central router?** Coordinator →
   **Orchestrator + Specialists**. Peers → **Swarm**. A single agent
   passes the conversation onward → **Handoff**.

The decision tree below is the same questions in diagram form.

                                                              one agent
                                                              hands off?
                                                                  │

                                                                Handoff
```

Writing your own glue (asyncio fan-out, retries, schedulers)? Use the
**Functional API** (`@task`, `@entrypoint`) — a thin wrapper that brings
agent runs into the ordinary asyncio universe.

## The eight shapes

Eight shapes across seven pattern pages —
[Composition](multi-agent/composition.md) covers three of them
(Sequential, Parallel, Loop) in one page, and the Functional API rides
alongside as the asyncio-native escape hatch.

| Pattern | Best for | Key class | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[Composition](multi-agent/composition.md)** | linear chains; fan-out + merge; revise-until-confidence | `SequentialPipeline`, `ParallelPipeline`, `LoopAgent` | [`agent/composition.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/agent/composition.py) |
| **[Orchestrator + Specialists](multi-agent/orchestrator.md)** | one router decides which expert handles each sub-task | `Orchestrator`, `Specialist` | [`multiagent/orchestrator.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/multiagent/orchestrator.py) |
| **[Swarm](multi-agent/swarm.md)** | open-ended research; peer-to-peer; shared context | `Swarm`, `SharedContext` | [`multiagent/swarm.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/multiagent/swarm.py) |
| **[Handoff](multi-agent/handoff.md)** | escalation desks; investigation moves with a findings + progress summary | `Handoff`, `HandoffAgent`, `create_handoff_manager` | [`multiagent/handoff.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/multiagent/handoff.py) |
| **[StateGraph](multi-agent/graph.md)** | explicit DAG with cycles, conditional edges, subgraphs | `StateGraph`, `Node`, `Edge` | [`multiagent/graph.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/multiagent/graph.py) |
| **[Functional](multi-agent/functional.md)** | map/reduce over agents; asyncio-native composition | `@task`, `@entrypoint` | [`multiagent/functional.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/multiagent/functional.py) |
| **[A2A](multi-agent/a2a.md)** | cross-process / cross-runtime; capability discovery | `A2AServer`, `A2AClient`, `AgentCard` | [`a2a/protocol.py`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/blob/main/src/tulip/a2a/protocol.py) |

## Workflow primitives

The pieces every shape is built from. Drop them into any graph node.

### `Send` — scatter / map-reduce

```python
from tulip.core.send import Send
async def split(state):
    return [Send("worker", {"task": t}) for t in state["tasks"]]
```

Returning a list of `Send` from a node spawns parallel executions —
no `asyncio.gather`, no shared mutable state. Each result lands in
`state[send.send_id]` keyed by the send id.

### `interrupt()` — pause for a human

```python
from tulip.core import interrupt

async def approval_node(state):
    response = interrupt({"question": "Ship it?", "options": ["yes", "no"]})
    return {"approved": response == "yes"}
```

`interrupt()` raises `InterruptException`; the graph catches it,
snapshots state, and returns control to the caller. Resume by calling
`graph.execute(Command(resume="yes"))`.

### `Command(goto=...)` — explicit routing

```python
from tulip.core import goto

async def smart_router(state):
    if state["urgent"]:
        return goto("emergency", priority=10)   # skip ahead
    return {"score": compute_score(state)}      # normal flow
```

Return a `Command` from a node to override the default edge — useful
for short-circuiting refinement loops or skipping straight to sign-off.
Used to skip the revision loop when the analyst says RESOLVED.

### `Agent(output_schema=...)` — typed terminal artifacts

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from tulip.agent import Agent, AgentConfig
class Verdict(BaseModel):
    disposition: str   # "true_positive" | "benign"
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str

agent = Agent(config=AgentConfig(model="{{ tulip_example_model }}", output_schema=Verdict))
result = agent.run_sync("...")
verdict: Verdict = result.parsed   # validated Pydantic instance, not free text
```

When you need a typed artifact at the workflow boundary — `Verdict`,
`Postmortem`, `ConcessionDecision`, `ContractDecision` — `output_schema`
gives you a validated Pydantic instance.

### `GraphConfig(allow_cycles=True)` — refinement loops

```python
from tulip.multiagent.graph import GraphConfig, StateGraph
graph = StateGraph(config=GraphConfig(allow_cycles=True, max_iterations=20))
graph.add_edge("critic", "writer")   # loop edge — only legal with allow_cycles
```

Cycles are off by default (so you can't accidentally infinite-loop).
Opt in with `allow_cycles=True` plus an iteration cap.

## Why these workflows ship to prod

The boring stuff that turns a demo into a product — typed terminal
artifacts, idempotent tools, checkpointing, reflexion, grounding, and
streaming — works in any of the eight shapes; you don't pick "shape" or
"production-ready", you get both. And a side-effecting tool in any
shape can be put behind the admission gate — wrap it with
[`gate_tool(...)`](control-layer.md) or call
[`admit()`](security-context.md) in its body, passing your
`ControlPolicy` and an `AuditTrail`. Every decision on it, whether allow,
hold or deny, is then appended to that hash-chained trail: each entry
commits to the one before it, so an edit, reorder, or deletion in the
middle breaks verification. Sign the trail and verify it against the
public key (`verify(keys=...)`), and a chain rebuilt around an edit by
anyone without your signing key fails too.

## One event stream across all of them

All eight shapes — A2A included — share the same typed event
taxonomy. Consume directly from the generator, or use the opt-in
`EventBus` to get per-component SSE events (`agent.think`,
`agent.tool.started`, `multiagent.orchestrator.routing`, etc.)
from every layer simultaneously:

```python
from tulip.observability import run_context, get_event_bus

async with run_context() as rid:
    result = await orchestrator.execute("Resolve the disputed orders in this morning's queue.")
    # The run is done: close its stream so the subscriber below replays
    # the recorded history and then stops, instead of waiting for more.
    await get_event_bus().close_stream(rid)

    async for ev in get_event_bus().subscribe(rid):
        match ev.event_type:
            case "multiagent.orchestrator.decision" if "specialists_selected" in ev.data:
                print("orchestrator →", ev.data["specialists_selected"])
            case "multiagent.specialist.completed":
                print("  ✓", ev.data["specialist_type"], ev.data.get("output_preview", ev.data.get("error")))
```

Orchestrator events carry `orchestrator_id` and specialist events carry
`specialist_id` and `specialist_type`, so you can attribute output to the
specialist that produced it. SSE streams from `AgentServer` carry the
same shape — your front-end consumer is unchanged whether the back-end
is a single agent, an orchestrator, a swarm, or an A2A mesh.

[SSE event catalogue](sse-events.md)

## Mixing shapes

A `StateGraph` node runs any async callable, so one node can await
`orchestrator.execute(...)`, another `swarm.execute(...)`, and a third
can be a whole `StateGraph` added as a subgraph. Give a node a
`retry_policy` and the graph re-runs it with backoff when it raises, up
to `max_attempts` times. A `TimeoutError`, including a node's own
`timeout_ms`, fails the node without a retry.
`Orchestrator.execute` and `Swarm.execute` catch their own errors and
return a result with `success=False`, so a node that wraps one should
check `result.success` and raise if you want the retry to fire. An
orchestrator still reports `success=True` when a single specialist
fails: that failure is on `result.specialist_results[<id>].error`, so
check it as well if a failed specialist should trigger the retry. Pick
the shape that fits each layer of the problem.
