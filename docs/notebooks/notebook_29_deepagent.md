# DeepAgent

`create_deepagent` bundles the configuration patterns for deep, methodical
investigation into one call: reflexion + grounding on by default, a typed
termination algebra, plus opt-in filesystem scratchspace, todo tracking,
subagent spawning, and datastore auto-wiring. The result is a plain
`tulip.Agent` — every hook, checkpointer, and observability primitive
attaches normally.

Here the agent runs a scoped service-fleet reliability review — the
pre-release readiness step of an on-call rotation, bounded to the
services a deploy window actually touches. It gathers facts with tools,
self-corrects via reflexion, grounds claims against tool results, and
submits a structured `ServiceReport`.

This notebook covers:

1. Basic `create_deepagent` with a typed submit tool — the agent loops
   with tools, self-corrects via reflexion, grounds claims against tool
   results, and submits a structured `ServiceReport`.
2. Filesystem-as-memory: `write_file` / `read_file` for scratchpad
   notes that persist across iterations without bloating context.
3. Todo tracking: `write_todos` / `read_todos` backed by a `TodoState`
   the caller can inspect after the run.
4. Subagent dispatch: `SubAgentDef` + `task(...)` — one-shot delegated
   investigations whose trajectories never reach the parent's context.
5. `deepagent.*` SSE events: `subagent.spawned/completed`, `fs.*`,
   `todo.*`.
6. **RAG grounding** — `datastores={name: {retriever, description, top_k}}`
   auto-wires a `search_<name>` tool from any `RAGRetriever` and
   prepends a routing block to the system prompt. The path exercised
   here is `QdrantVectorStore` + `OpenAIEmbeddings` over prior incident
   notes; absent an embedding key, Part 5 exits cleanly.

The factory is convenience-only: the returned Agent has nothing
"DeepAgent-specific" once it's built. Typed termination reads like a
sentence — `(ToolCalled("submit") & ConfidenceMet(0.85))
| TokenLimit(80_000)` — and can be unit-tested without a model.

## Domain — the deploy-window inventory

The shared fixture is a small service-fleet inventory: `api-gateway`,
`payments-worker`, and `web-frontend`, each with a description, its
currently firing alerts, and a last-deploy date. Three tools read it —
`list_services`, `inspect_service`, and `count_active_alerts` — and the
agent submits a `ServiceReport` via `submit_review` once confidence
clears 0.85. Scope discipline matters: `inspect_service` refuses any
name outside the deploy window.

## Prerequisites

- Agent basics.
- Typed termination conditions.
- For Part 5 only: `OPENAI_API_KEY` for embeddings.

## Run

```bash
python examples/notebook_29_deepagent.py
```

The default provider is the bundled mock model. Set
`TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` (openai / anthropic) and credentials to
use a live model. Keep `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` for offline runs.

Multi-backend ports (in-memory + OpenSearch) live in
[`examples/projects/deep-research`](https://github.com/tuliplabs-ai/tulip-agents/tree/main/examples/projects/deep-research).
