# Supervisor + Critic

A privacy analyst gathers evidence notes, an author drafts a
data-exposure report, and a skeptical reviewer either approves or sends
it back for revision. The loop caps at two revisions to bound runtime.

The point is the *last* step, not the loop: a report that reads well is
not the same as a report that is grounded. Before anything ships, the
reviewer runs the drafted finding through `ground_finding` — the GSAR
grounding gate from `tulip.security`. A finding is emitted only when its
evidence partition clears the proceed threshold; otherwise the call
returns an `Abstention` and nothing reaches the privacy queue. An
unproven PII-exposure claim is a false positive *by construction* and
never ships.

This notebook covers:

- Control flow as a `StateGraph` with conditional edges — no
  hand-rolled `while True`.
- Each role is its own `Agent` with a role-specific system prompt.
  Roles communicate only through state keys (`notes`, `draft`,
  `revision_request`).
- The reviewer node where prose review meets mechanical grounding:
  `ground_finding(...)` scores the evidence `Partition` of typed
  `Claim`s and returns an `Evidence` or an `Abstention`;
  `is_finding(...)` narrows the union.
- `stream(mode=StreamMode.NODES)` emits one event per node completion
  for live UI updates.
- `execute(...)` returns the authoritative final state plus a
  `GraphResult` with timing and iteration metrics.

```text
START → gather → draft → review → END (ship grounded Evidence | abstain)
                   ↑         │
                   └── revise (cap: 2)
```

The seeded scenario: DLP scan `DLP-4471` flags an unmasked `email`
column in the analytics `customer_export` view. The grounded claims
trace to the DLP scan rows and the data-lineage graph; the lone
unproven claim — that the records were actually accessed by an
unauthorized third party — has no backing evidence, so the grounding
gate keeps it out of the shipped finding. The drafted finding is tagged
with `OwaspLLM.SENSITIVE_INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE` and
`AtlasTechnique.EXFILTRATION_VIA_AGENT_TOOL` so the artifact is portable
into a privacy register or DPIA.

## Prerequisites

- Basic graph.
- Agent handoff, for an alternative shape.
- GSAR grounded findings, for the grounding primitive in depth.

## Run

```bash
python examples/notebook_31_supervisor_critic_loop.py
```

The default provider is the bundled mock model. Set
`TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` (openai / anthropic) and credentials to use a
live model. Set `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock` for offline runs — the
grounding gate is deterministic and exercises the same admit/abstain
path either way.
