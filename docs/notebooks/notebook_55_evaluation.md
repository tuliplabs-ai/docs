# Evaluation

Treat the privacy-review agent like any other piece of code. Declare
cases, run them, read the report. Tulip ships a small, dependency-free
harness so you don't need an external eval framework for the common cases.

- `EvalCase` declares prompt plus expected substrings (positive or negative).
- `EvalRunner` runs the agent against every case.
- `EvalReport` summarises pass/fail counts and an average score.

Here WARDEN — a tier-1 data-access reviewer — classifies each
data-handling request as `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`. The suite pins a
known-disallowed PII export, a known-allowed aggregate report, and a
negative case that guards against the agent inventing a regulation
citation no facts support (OWASP LLM09, Misinformation). Run it on every
prompt or model change before it reaches production.

Run it (defaults to the bundled mock model; set `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` to `openai` / `anthropic` for a live model):
