# Verify findings before you act on them

A Tulip ``Evidence`` is a *claim*. Before you act on it, ``verify()`` puts it through an
independent skeptic that challenges the evidence and scores confidence. A
well-grounded finding **survives**; an unsupported one is **refuted**, with the
objections listed. ``verify()`` only returns the verdict: gate the action on
``survives`` so a refuted finding never reaches it. The default skeptic grades
the evidence a finding carries; it does not check that the references are real.

``verify()`` takes a Tulip ``Evidence`` *or* a finding-shaped dict (``title``,
``severity``, ``gsar_score``, ``evidence_refs``, ``confidence``), so a finding
produced outside Tulip goes through the same challenge. The
notebook verifies a real grounded finding (survives), a fabricated one with no
evidence (refuted), and an external finding that has references but was never
grounded (refuted).
