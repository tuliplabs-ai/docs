# Agentic AI red-teaming

The centerpiece of ``tulip.security``: point a ``Target`` at an AI system
and run the OWASP-ASI / MITRE-ATLAS red-team suite. Every result is a grounded
``Evidence`` (the attack landed, with tool-backed evidence) or an ``Abstention``
(no evidence — so nothing is asserted).

That abstain-by-construction property matters because AI scorers can
hallucinate vulnerabilities; Tulip does not ship a finding it cannot
evidence. The notebook points the same suite at two targets — a *vulnerable* bot
that obeys injected instructions (→ grounded ``Evidence``) and a *hardened* one that
refuses them (→ Abstentions).

Runs fully offline via ``Target.from_callable``. Point
``Target.endpoint(url, ...)`` at a real LLM / agent endpoint to red-team it for
real.

Run it:
    python examples/notebook_75_agent_red_team.py

## Output

Running it offline — no credentials, bundled mock model — prints what a red-team run reports:

The vulnerable bot produced grounded Findings; the hardened bot abstained across the board. No vulnerability is ever asserted without evidence.
