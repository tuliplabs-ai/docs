# Steering

`SteeringHook` runs a second LLM ("the steering model") in front of
every tool call. The steering model reads a natural-language policy
plus the agent's activity so far, then returns one of three actions:

- `PROCEED` — let the tool call go through.
- `GUIDE` — cancel the tool call and return the guidance message in
  its place, so the agent reads the correction instead of the result.
- `INTERRUPT` — cancel the tool call and flag it as requiring human
  approval (returns a `REQUIRES APPROVAL` message).

The result is a real-time guardrail you can author in plain English —
no rules engine, no policy DSL. In an infra/devops setting this lets you
hold an on-call agent to a read-only diagnostics session: it can query
Prometheus and read logs, but a mutating operation — restarting a
service, scaling a deployment, terminating an instance — is blocked
unless a human approves it.

- `SteeringHook(model=..., policy="...")` — attach it to any agent via
  the `hooks=` parameter.
- `steering.decisions` — every action with its reason, for audit.

The configured provider drives both the agent and the steering model.

## Run it

The bundled mock model is the default; set `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` for a live provider:

```bash
TULIP_MODEL_ID=openai.gpt-4.1 python examples/notebook_49_steering.py
```

Offline:

```bash
TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock python examples/notebook_49_steering.py
```

## Prerequisites

- An OpenAI or Anthropic API key, or `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` set to
  `openai` / `anthropic` / `mock`.

## Source

```python
--8<-- "examples/notebook_49_steering.py"
```
