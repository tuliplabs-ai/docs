# A cloud-ops agent that can only touch production with a human's say-so

A cloud-ops agent is handy and dangerous in the same breath. It can free up a
forgotten dev box in seconds — and it can just as easily terminate the database
the whole product runs on, or hand an outside principal admin over your account.
The model deciding *what* to do is not the place to enforce *whether* it is
allowed to. That belongs in code that runs before the API call.

This example puts ``admit`` in front of every cloud mutation. The agent proposes
an ``Action``; the gate weighs it against a ``ControlPolicy`` you wrote; the
actual cloud call (here a local stub — no network, no credentials) fires *only*
if the policy admits it. Small, contained changes proceed on their own. Anything
that touches a production resource, or reaches across many resources at once, is
held for a human. Either way the decision lands on a tamper-evident
``AuditTrail``, so there is no un-recorded path to a side effect.

    AuditTrail records every attempt — admitted or not

The policy gates on two attributes of the action. ``max_blast_radius`` caps how
many resources one action may touch and still auto-proceed: resizing a single
dev instance is blast radius 1; deleting an auto-scaling group of 12 nodes is
blast radius 12. ``require_human_for`` lists labels that always need a person —
``production`` and ``iam`` here, but you can add a specific tag, ``billing``, or
anything else. ``require_verification_score`` is set to ``0.0`` because a cloud
mutation is an ops action, not a security finding: there is no verdict to weigh,
so the gate reasons purely over blast radius and the labels on the action.

``admit()`` is the single enforcement point. It asks the policy, records the
decision to the ``AuditTrail`` whether or not it allows, and only then awaits
``perform``. The script runs two attempts through it. The first resizes a
staging CI runner — blast radius 1, not production — so the gate lets it through
and the in-memory inventory shows the new instance size. The second tries to
terminate the production primary database; the ``production`` label trips the
gate, the terminate call never fires, and the row is left exactly as it was. A
model that is jailbroken, prompt-injected, or just wrong still cannot push that
production change past the gate.

Both attempts land on the trail next to each other — the resize that ran and the
terminate that was held — and ``trail.verify()`` confirms the SHA-256 chain is
intact, so the record is tamper-evident. ``perform`` is a local stub: each
side-effect function mutates an in-memory ``INVENTORY`` / ``IAM`` dict instead of
calling boto3, the OCI SDK, or ``gcloud``, so the script runs offline with no
cloud account, no creds, no network. Swap those functions for real API calls and
the gate is unchanged.

Run it (fully offline — no cloud account, no credentials needed):
