# Termination Conditions

Every agent loop needs to know when to stop. A customer-support agent
that keeps talking to itself wastes budget and leaves the customer
waiting, so a ticket-resolution loop must end after a fixed number of
turns, a time limit, or as soon as the agent declares the issue
resolved. Tulip ships small predicates you compose with `|` (OR) and
`&` (AND) to describe the exit condition exactly. This notebook also
covers two related conveniences: `output_key` and a callable
`system_prompt`.

What you'll learn:

- Termination predicates: `MaxIterations`, `TextMention`, `TokenLimit`,
  `TimeLimit`, `ConfidenceMet`, plus `CustomCondition(callable)`.
- Combining with `|` and `&` — and inspecting the result by calling
  `.check(state)` directly (e.g. `MaxIterations(5) |
  TextMention("TICKET_RESOLVED")`).
- `output_key="resolution"` to drop the final message into
  `result.state.metadata["resolution"]` so downstream agents don't have
  to parse prose.
- A callable `system_prompt(ctx)` that reads `ctx["metadata"]` and
  returns different instructions per run — a tier-1 agent versus a
  billing specialist writing for customers.

Run it:

```
.venv/bin/python examples/notebook_15_termination.py
```

Uses the bundled mock model by default. Set `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER` to
openai / anthropic for a live model; keep `TULIP_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock`
for offline runs.
