# Research

Findings from building Tulip — an open-source Python agent framework — and the
control layer that decides which of an agent's actions may run.
Everything here comes from running code against real catalogs, real tools and
real models. The method and the scoring code are public and runnable against
your own endpoint; where a result depends on a model or a corpus we do not
redistribute, the page says so, and where a result is a single illustration
rather than a benchmark, it says that too.

## Papers

**[GSAR: Typed Grounding for Hallucination Detection and Recovery in
Multi-Agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.23366)** — 2026. Uses a judge to partition claims into grounded / ungrounded /
contradicted / complementary against typed evidence, scores the partition, and
routes the result to proceed, regenerate, replan or abstain. Evaluated with
multiple LLM judges on FEVER.

Implemented in the SDK as [GSAR](../concepts/gsar.md); `ground_finding()`
returns evidence *or* an abstention, so an ungrounded claim is not something
the caller can accidentally ship.

## Findings

**[The family of harm your agent policy cannot see](policy-blindness.md)** — a
risk policy tends to encode one family of consequence and stay silent about the
others, and the silence survives code review, its own tests, validation against
the real tool catalog, and training.

Three independent instances, one of them measured: **Clusiana-Admit-4B** on
3,139 distinct held-out items reaches a 1.88% false-allow rate. Row-weighted
across the 8,989-row split, those errors cluster by family — 5.45% on execution
and 5.32% on egress against 0.00% on destruction. Includes a
seven-model comparison against GPT-5 and Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku on identical
rows, and the reason the headline number from that comparison is misleading.
